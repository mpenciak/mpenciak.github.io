    I am currently in the last year of my Zelevinsky Postdoctoral Fellowship at Northeastern University. I host most of my work on my <a href="https://github.com/mpenciak">personal github page</a>. This is the most up to date location for what I've been working on. 
</p>

<p>
    I have a variety of interests including algebraic geometry, integrable systems, and the formalization of those topics in mathlib. The primary programming languages I use are Python, Lean, and Haskell. Check out my past, present, and future <a href="/projects/">project goals</a>.

    I am currently on the job market, so if any of the skills outlined on my <a href="/aboutme/">about me</a> page sound relevant, feel free to contact me at my provided email below.
