Hello! My name is Matej Penciak, I received my Ph.D. in mathematics under the direction of Tom Nevins at UIUC.

Since then I have been a Zelevinsky Postdoctoral Fellow at Northeastern University. My research is focused on **algebraic geometry**, and **integrable systems**. More recently I have gotten interested in **formalization**, and **programming languages**.

Check out my up to date [CV](../assets/pdfs/MP_CV.pdf) and all the [projects](../projects/) I've been thinking about.

## Technical proficiencies

* Python, together with common scientific computing, quantum computing, and machine learning packages like SciPy, Qiskit, and PyTorch.
* Dependently typed functional programming languages like Lean.
* Haskell.
* Computer algebra software like Mathematica, Maple, and MATLAB.

## Work experience

* Zelevinsky Postdoctoral Fellow at Northeastern University. _Aug. 2019 - Now_
* Teaching and Research Assistant at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign _Aug. 2012 - May 2019_
