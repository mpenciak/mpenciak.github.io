My name is Matej Penciak, and I am currently a software engineer at [Lurk Lab](https://github.com/lurk-lab) where I'm helping build the tools for a safe and trusted decentralized web.

I'm interested in **formal verification**, **proof formalization**, and how they interact.

Before this I was a research mathematician interested in **algebraic geometry**, and **integrable systems**. I still like to dabble in the field.

Check out my up to date [CV](../assets/pdfs/MP_CV.pdf) and all the [projects](../projects/) I've been thinking about.
