Hello! My name is Matej Penciak, I received my Ph.D. in mathematics under the direction of Tom Nevins at UIUC.

Since then I have been a Zelevinsky Postdoctoral Fellow at Northeastern University. My research is focused on **algebraic geometry**, and **integrable systems**. More recently I have gotten interested in **formalization**, and **programming languages**.

Check out my up to date [CV](../assets/pdfs/MP_CV.pdf) and all the [projects](../projects/) I've been thinking about.

Also, I am on the job market! So if any of these skills sound appealing to you, feel free to contact me <matej.penciak@gmail.com>!
