## Website features

* Make the landing page emphasize the about me and projects pages more than the blog.
* Actually use (and learn some) CSS to make the padding on the about me page less hacky.
* Maybe make the image animate like the avitar on other pages? (this would be fancy, but the about me page would have to get longer)
* Add highlights from my CV on my about me page without the pdf.

## Posts

* One post per project?
